"Baskervald ADF is a serif family with lining figures designed as a "
"substitute for Baskerville. The family currently includes upright and italic "
"or oblique shapes in each of regular, bold and heavy weights. All fonts "
"include the slashed zero and additional non-standard ligatures. The support "
"package renames them according to the Karl Berry fontname scheme and defines "
"two families. One of these primarily provides access to the \"standard\" or "
"default characters while the other supports additional ligatures. The "
"included package files provide access to these features in LaTeX.\n"

"the LaTeX font selection scheme (nfss). The package doesn't parse, format "
"and print PGN input like e.g. the packages skak or texmate; the aim of the "
"package is to offer writers of chess packages a bundle of commands for "
"fonts, so that they don't have to implement all these commands for "
"themselves. A normal user can use the package to print e.g. single chess "
"symbols and simple diagrams. The documentation contains also a section about "

"The Cyclop typeface was designed in the 1920s at the workshop of Warsaw type "
"foundry \"Odlewnia Czcionek J. Idzkowski i S-ka\". This sans serif typeface "
"has a highly modulated stroke so it has high typographic contrast. The "
"vertical stems are much heavier then horizontal ones. Most characters have "
"thin rectangles as additional counters giving the unique shape of the "
"characters. The lead types of Cyclop typeface were produced in slanted "
"variant at sizes 8-48 pt. It was heavily used for heads in newspapers and "
"accidents prints. Typesetters used Cyclop in the inter-war period, during "
"the occupation in the underground press. The typeface was used until the "
"beginnings of the offset print and computer typesetting era. Nowadays it is "
"hard to find the metal types of this typeface. The font was generated using "
"the Metatype1 package. Then the original set of characters was completed by "
"adding the full set of accented letters and characters of the modern Latin "
"alphabets (including Vietnamese). The upright variant was generated and it "
"was more complicated task than it appeared at the beginning. 11 upright "
"letters of the Cyclop typeface were presented in the book by Filip Trzaska, "
"\"Podstawy techniki wydawniczej\" (\"Foundation of the publishing techonology"
"\"), Warsaw 1967. But even the author of the book does not know what was the "
"source of the presented examples. The fonts are distributed in the Type1 and "
"OpenType formats along with the files necessary for use these fonts in TeX "
"and LaTeX including encoding definition files: T1 (ec), T5 (Vietnamese), "
"OT4, QX, texnansi and nonstandard ones (IL2 for Czech fonts).\n"

"Around 2008, researcher Byron Cook and several colleagues began developing a "

"ideas about the relationships between structures expressable as mathematical "

"researchers communicated these new results to others in their community via "
"published papers, research talks, etc. Unfortunately, they found the symbols "
"already available for reasoning about relations lacking (in contrast to "
"sets, which have a long-ago developed and robust symbol vocabulary). Early "
"presentations were unnecessarily cluttered. To more elegantly express these "

"ranging from simple \"fix the spelling\" flags to critical \"this paragraph "
"is a lie\" mentions. Annotations like this should be visible during the "
"development or reviewing phase, but should normally disappear in the final "
"version of the document. FiXme is designed to ease and automate the process "
"of managing collaborative annotations, by offering a set of predefined note "
"levels and layouts, the possibility to register multiple authors, to "
"reference annotations by listing and indexing etc. FiXme is extensible, "
"giving you the possibility to create new layouts or even complete \"themes"

"HEPparticles is a set of macros for typesetting high energy particle names, "

"Additionally a superscript and/or subscript may follow the main symbol. 3. "
"Particle resonances may also have a resonance specifier which is typeset in "

"be followed by sub- and superscripts. 4. The particle names are expected to "
"be used both in and out of mathematical contexts. 5. If the surrounding text "
"is bold or italic then the particle name should adapt to that context as "
"best as possible (this may not be possible for Greek symbols). A consequence "

"XMP (eXtensible Metadata Platform) is a mechanism proposed by Adobe for "

"designed to be easy to extract, even by programs that are oblivious to the "
"document's file format. Most of Adobe's applications store XMP metadata when "
"saving files. Now, with the hyperxmp package, it is trivial for LaTeX "
"document authors to store XMP metadata in their documents as well. Version "
"2.2 of the package added support for the IPTC Photo Metadata schema. It "
"allows \\xmpcomma and \\xmpquote to be used in any hyperxmp option, not only "
"those that require special treatment of commas. And it introduces an "
"\\xmplinesep macro that controls how multiline fields are represented in the "
"XMP packet. The package integrates seamlessly with hyperref and requires "
"virtually no modifications to documents that already exploit hyperref's "
"mechanisms for specifying PDF metadata. The current version of hyperxmp can "
"embed the following metadata as XMP: title, authors, primary author's title "
"or position, metadata writer, subject/summary, keywords, copyright, license "
"URL, document base URL, document identifier and instance identifier, "
"language, source file name, PDF generating tool, PDF version, and contact "
"telephone number/postal address/email address/URL. Hyperxmp currently embeds "
"XMP only within PDF documents; it is compatible with pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX, LaTeX"
"+dvipdfm, and LaTeX+dvips+ps2pdf.\n"

"MonTeX provides Mongolian and Manju support for the TeX/LaTeX community. "
"Mongolian is a language spoken in North East Asia, namely Mongolia and the "
"Inner Mongol Autonomous Region of China. Today, it is written in an extended "
"Cyrillic alphabet in Mongolia whereas the Uighur writing continues to be in "
"use in Inner Mongolia, though it is also, legally speaking, the official "
"writing system of Mongolia. Manju is another language of North East Asia, "
"belonging to the Tungusic branch of the Altaic languages. Though it is "
"hardly spoken nowadays, it survives in written form as Manju was the native "
"language of the rulers of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) in China. Large "
"quantities of documents of the Imperial Archives survive, as well as some of "
"the finest dictionaries ever compiled in Asia, like the Pentaglot, a "
"dictionary comprising Manju, Tibetan, Mongolian, Uighur and Chinese. MonTeX "
"provides all necessary characters for writing standard Mongolian in Cyrillic "
"and Classical (aka Traditional or Uighur) writing, and Manju as well as "
"transliterated Tibetan texts, for which purpose a number of additional "
"characters was created. In MonTeX, both Mongolian and Manju are entered in "
"romanized form. The retransliteration (from Latin input to Mongolian and "
"Manju output) is completely realized in TeX/Metafont so that no external "
"preprocessor is required. Please note that most of the enhanced functions of "
"MonTeX require a working e-LaTeX environment. This is especially true when "
"compiling documents with Mongolian or Manju as the main document language. "
"It is recommended to choose pdfelatex as the resulting PDF files are truly "
"portable. Vertical text generated by MonTeX is not supported in DVI.\n"

"the enhancement of the Latin Modern collection) provide glyphs sufficient "
"for typesetting of romanized transliterations of Arabic and Sanskrit "
"scripts. The Antykwa Poltawskiego family consists of 4 weights (light, "
"normal, medium, bold), each having upright and italic forms and one of 5 "
"design sizes: 6, 8, 10, 12 and 17pt. Altogether, the collection comprises 40 "

"The package provides macros that help to build a document repository for "
"long living documents. It focuses on structure and re-use of text, code, "
"figures etc. The basic concept is first to separate structure from content "
"(i.e., text about a topic from the structure it is presented by) and then "
"separating the content from the actual published document, thus enabling "
"easy re-use of text blocks in different publications (i.e., text about a "
"protocol in a short article about this protocol as well as in a book about "
"many protocols); all without constantly copying or changing text. As a side "
"effect, using the document classes provided, it hides a lot of LaTeX from "
"someone who just wants to write articles and books.\n"

"options and switches. This is furthermore done in such a way that it is very "
"easy to add more such commands for documenting things, such as e.g., "
"templates (an important concept in the future LaTeX3) and program components "
"for other languages (functions, classes, procedures, etc.). A side effect is "
"that many minor bugs in doc are fixed. The design aims to take advantage of "
"many still experimental features of future versions of LaTeX, but since "
"these are neither reasonably stable nor widely available, the configuration "
"interfaces and package author commands of xdoc are likely to change. To "
"still provide a stable interface for other packages to build upon, the "
"actual package names include a \"major version number\" of sorts. The drop-"
"in replacement package for standard doc is xdoc2; it requires nothing "
"outside standard LaTeX2e. The docindex/docidx2e package changes the index "
"and list of changes typesetting so that none of the formatting has to be "
"controlled via the index style file. The docindex package provides control "
"of formatting via templates (nice interface, but requires several "
"experimental packages), whereas the docidx2e package has traditional raw "
