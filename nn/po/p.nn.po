"This module is based on \"'Carp.pm'\" from Perl 5.005_03. It has been "
"modified to skip all package names matching the pattern given in the \"use\" "
"statement inside the \"'qw()'\" term (or argument list).\n"
"\n"
"Suppose you have a family of modules or classes named \"Pack::A\", \"Pack::B"
"\" and so on, and each of them uses \"'Carp::Clan qw(^Pack::);'\" (or at "
"least the one in which the error or warning gets raised).\n"
"\n"
"Thus when for example your script \"tool.pl\" calls module \"Pack::A\", and "
"module \"Pack::A\" calls module \"Pack::B\", an exception raised in module "
"\"Pack::B\" will appear to have originated in \"tool.pl\" where \"Pack::A\" "
"was called, and not in \"Pack::A\" where \"Pack::B\" was called, as the "
"unmodified \"'Carp.pm'\" would try to make you believe ':-)'.\n"
"\n"
"This works similarly if \"Pack::B\" calls \"Pack::C\" where the exception is "
"raised, etcetera.\n"
"\n"
"In other words, this blames all errors in the \"'Pack::*'\" modules on the "
"user of these modules, i.e., on you. ';-)'\n"
"\n"
"The skipping of a clan (or family) of packages according to a pattern "
"describing its members is necessary in cases where these modules are not "
"classes derived from each other (and thus when examining '@ISA' - as in the "
"original \"'Carp.pm'\" module - doesn't help).\n"
"\n"
"The purpose and advantage of this is that a \"clan\" of modules can work "
"together (and call each other) and throw exceptions at various depths down "
"the calling hierarchy and still appear as a monolithic block (as though they "
"were a single module) from the perspective of the caller.\n"
"\n"
"In case you just want to ward off all error messages from the module in "
"which you \"'use Carp::Clan'\", i.e., if you want to make all error messages "
"or warnings to appear to originate from where your module was called (this "
"is what you usually used to \"'use Carp;'\" for ';-)'), instead of in your "
"module itself (which is what you can do with a \"die\" or \"warn\" anyway), "
"you do not need to provide a pattern, the module will automatically provide "
"the correct one for you.\n"
"\n"
"I.e., just \"'use Carp::Clan;'\" without any arguments and call \"carp\" or "
"\"croak\" as appropriate, and they will automatically defend your module "
"against all blames!\n"
"\n"
"In other words, a pattern is only necessary if you want to make several "
"modules (more than one) work together and appear as though they were only "
"one."

"Class::Data::Inheritable is for creating accessor/mutators to class data. "
"That is, if you want to store something about your class as a whole (instead "

"\n"
"     $suitcase = Raygun->Suitcase;\n"
"\n"
"Raygun inherits its Suitcase class data from Pere::Ubu.\n"
"\n"
"Inheritance of class data works analogous to method inheritance. As long as "
"Raygun does not \"override\" its inherited class data (by using Suitcase() "

"inherit further changes:\n"
"\n"
"     Pere::Ubu->Suitcase('Blue');\n"

#. Module-Basesystem/perl-Dist-CheckConflicts/description
msgid ""
"One shortcoming of the CPAN clients that currently exist is that they have "
"no way of specifying conflicting downstream dependencies of modules. This "
"module attempts to work around this issue by allowing you to specify "
"conflicting versions of modules separately, and deal with them after the "
"module is done installing.\n"
"\n"
"For instance, say you have a module 'Foo', and some other module 'Bar' uses "
"'Foo'. If 'Foo' were to change its API in a non-backwards-compatible way, "
"this would cause 'Bar' to break until it is updated to use the new API. "
"'Foo' can't just depend on the fixed version of 'Bar', because this will "
"cause a circular dependency (because 'Bar' is already depending on 'Foo'), "
"and this doesn't express intent properly anyway - 'Foo' doesn't use 'Bar' at "
"all. The ideal solution would be for there to be a way to specify "
"conflicting versions of modules in a way that would let CPAN clients update "
"conflicting modules automatically after an existing module is upgraded, but "
"until that happens, this module will allow users to do this manually.\n"
"\n"
"This module accepts a hash of options passed to its 'use' statement, with "
"these keys being valid: \n"
"* -conflicts\n"
"\n"
"  A hashref of conflict specifications, where keys are module names, and   "
"values are the last broken version - any version greater than the   "
"specified version should work. \n"
"* -also\n"
"\n"
"  Additional modules to get conflicts from (potentially recursively). This   "
"should generally be a list of modules which use Dist::CheckConflicts,   "
"which correspond to the dists that your dist depends on. (In an ideal   "
"world, this would be intuited directly from your dependency list, but the   "
"dependency list isn't available outside of build time). \n"
"* -dist\n"
"\n"
"  The name of the distribution, to make the error message from   "
"check_conflicts more user-friendly.\n"
"\n"
"The methods listed below are exported by this module into the module that "
"uses it, so you should call these methods on your module, not Dist::"
"CheckConflicts.\n"
"\n"
"As an example, this command line can be used to update your modules, after "
"installing the 'Foo' dist (assuming that 'Foo::Conflicts' is the module in "

">{package} } Foo::Conflicts->calculate_conflicts' | cpanm\n"

msgstr ""

#. Module-Basesystem/perl-Encode-Locale/description
msgid ""
"In many applications it's wise to let Perl use Unicode for the strings it "
"processes. Most of the interfaces Perl has to the outside world are still "
"byte based. Programs therefore need to decode byte strings that enter the "
"program from the outside and encode them again on the way out.\n"
"\n"
"The POSIX locale system is used to specify both the language conventions "
"requested by the user and the preferred character set to consume and output. "
"The 'Encode::Locale' module looks up the charset and encoding (called a "
"CODESET in the locale jargon) and arranges for the the Encode manpage module "
"to know this encoding under the name \"locale\". It means bytes obtained "
"from the environment can be converted to Unicode strings by calling 'Encode::"
"encode(locale => $bytes)' and converted back again with 'Encode::"
"decode(locale => $string)'.\n"
"\n"
"Where file systems interfaces pass file names in and out of the program we "
"also need care. The trend is for operating systems to use a fixed file "
"encoding that don't actually depend on the locale; and this module "
"determines the most appropriate encoding for file names. The the Encode "
"manpage module will know this encoding under the name \"locale_fs\". For "
"traditional Unix systems this will be an alias to the same encoding as "
"\"locale\".\n"
"\n"
"For programs running in a terminal window (called a \"Console\" on some "
"systems) the \"locale\" encoding is usually a good choice for what to expect "
"as input and output. Some systems allows us to query the encoding set for "
"the terminal and 'Encode::Locale' will do that if available and make these "
"encodings known under the 'Encode' aliases \"console_in\" and \"console_out"
"\". For systems where we can't determine the terminal encoding these will be "
"aliased as the same encoding as \"locale\". The advice is to use \"console_in"
"\" for input known to come from the terminal and \"console_out\" for output "
"to the terminal.\n"
"\n"
"In addition to arranging for various Encode aliases the following functions "
"and variables are provided: \n"
"* decode_argv( ) \n"
"* decode_argv( Encode::FB_CROAK )\n"
"\n"
"  This will decode the command line arguments to perl (the '@ARGV' array)   "
"in-place.\n"
"\n"
"  The function will by default replace characters that can't be decoded by   "
"\"\\x{FFFD}\", the Unicode replacement character.\n"
"\n"
"  Any argument provided is passed as CHECK to underlying Encode::decode()   "
"call. Pass the value 'Encode::FB_CROAK' to have the decoding croak if not   "
"all the command line arguments can be decoded. See the Encode/\"Handling   "
"Malformed Data\" manpage for details on other options for CHECK. \n"
"* env( $uni_key ) \n"
"* env( $uni_key => $uni_value )\n"
"\n"
"  Interface to get/set environment variables. Returns the current value as   "
"a Unicode string. The $uni_key and $uni_value arguments are expected to   be "
"Unicode strings as well. Passing 'undef' as $uni_value deletes the   "
"environment variable named $uni_key.\n"
"\n"
"  The returned value will have the characters that can't be decoded   "
"replaced by \"\\x{FFFD}\", the Unicode replacement character.\n"
"\n"
"  There is no interface to request alternative CHECK behavior as for   "
"decode_argv(). If you need that you need to call encode/decode yourself.   "
"For example:\n"
"\n"
"      my $key = Encode::encode(locale => $uni_key, Encode::FB_CROAK);       "
"my $uni_value = Encode::decode(locale => $ENV{$key}, Encode::FB_CROAK); \n"
"* reinit( ) \n"
"* reinit( $encoding )\n"
"\n"
"  Reinitialize the encodings from the locale. You want to call this   "
"function if you changed anything in the environment that might influence   "
"the locale.\n"
"\n"
"  This function will croak if the determined encoding isn't recognized by   "
"the Encode module.\n"
"\n"
"  With argument force $ENCODING_... variables to set to the given value. \n"
"* $ENCODING_LOCALE\n"
"\n"
"  The encoding name determined to be suitable for the current locale. the   "
"Encode manpage know this encoding as \"locale\". \n"

"IO::HTML provides an easy way to open a file containing HTML while "

"The algorithm as implemented here is: \n"
"* 1.\n"
"\n"
"  If the file begins with a byte order mark indicating UTF-16LE, UTF-16BE,   "
"or UTF-8, then that is the encoding. \n"

"\n"
"  If the first 1024 bytes of the file contain a '<meta>' tag that "

"\n"
"    <meta charset=\"...\">     <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content="
"\"...charset=...\">\n"

"  The search is case-insensitive, and the order of attributes within the   "

"This module provides a few convenience methods for testing exception based "

"\n"
"If you are not already familiar with Test::More now would be the time to go "
"take a look.\n"
"\n"
"You can specify the test plan when you 'use Test::Exception' in the same way "
"as 'use Test::More'. See Test::More for details.\n"
"\n"
"NOTE: Test::Exception only checks for exceptions. It will ignore other "
"methods of stopping program execution - including exit(). If you have an "
"exit() in evalled code Test::Exception will not catch this with any of its "
"testing functions.\n"
"\n"
"NOTE: This module uses Sub::Uplevel and relies on overriding 'CORE::GLOBAL::"
"caller' to hide your test blocks from the call stack. If this use of global "
"overrides concerns you, the Test::Fatal module offers a more minimalist "
"alternative. \n"
"* *throws_ok*\n"
"\n"
"Tests to see that a specific exception is thrown. throws_ok() has two "
"forms:\n"
"\n"
"  throws_ok BLOCK REGEX, TEST_DESCRIPTION   throws_ok BLOCK CLASS, "
"TEST_DESCRIPTION\n"
"\n"
"In the first form the test passes if the stringified exception matches the "
"give regular expression. For example:\n"
"\n"
"    throws_ok { read_file( 'unreadable' ) } qr/No file/, 'no file';\n"
"\n"
"If your perl does not support 'qr//' you can also pass a regex-like string, "
"for example:\n"
"\n"
"    throws_ok { read_file( 'unreadable' ) } '/No file/', 'no file';\n"
"\n"
"The second form of throws_ok() test passes if the exception is of the same "
"class as the one supplied, or a subclass of that class. For example:\n"
"\n"
"    throws_ok { $foo->bar } \"Error::Simple\", 'simple error';\n"
"\n"
"Will only pass if the 'bar' method throws an Error::Simple exception, or a "
"subclass of an Error::Simple exception.\n"
"\n"
"You can get the same effect by passing an instance of the exception you want "
"to look for. The following is equivalent to the previous example:\n"
"\n"
"    my $SIMPLE = Error::Simple->new;     throws_ok { $foo->bar } $SIMPLE, "
"'simple error';\n"
"\n"
"Should a throws_ok() test fail it produces appropriate diagnostic messages. "
"For example:\n"
"\n"
"    not ok 3 - simple error               \n"
"\n"
"Like all other Test::Exception functions you can avoid prototypes by passing "
"a subroutine explicitly:\n"
"\n"
"    throws_ok( sub {$foo->bar}, \"Error::Simple\", 'simple error' );\n"
"\n"
"A true value is returned if the test succeeds, false otherwise. On exit $@ "
"is guaranteed to be the cause of death (if any).\n"
"\n"
"A description of the exception being checked is used if no optional test "
"description is passed.\n"
"\n"
"NOTE: Remember when you 'die $string_without_a_trailing_newline' perl will "
"automatically add the current script line number, input line number and a "
"newline. This will form part of the string that throws_ok regular "
"expressions match against. \n"
"* *dies_ok*\n"
"\n"
"Checks that a piece of code dies, rather than returning normally. For "
"example:\n"
"\n"
"    sub div {         my ( $a, $b ) = @_;         return $a / $b;     };\n"
"\n"
"    dies_ok { div( 1, 0 ) } 'divide by zero detected';\n"
"\n"
"         dies_ok( sub { div( 1, 0 ) }, 'divide by zero detected' );\n"
"\n"
"A true value is returned if the test succeeds, false otherwise. On exit $@ "
"is guaranteed to be the cause of death (if any).\n"
"\n"
"Remember: This test will pass if the code dies for any reason. If you care "
"about the reason it might be more sensible to write a more specific test "
"using throws_ok().\n"
"\n"
"The test description is optional, but recommended. \n"
"* *lives_ok*\n"
"\n"
"Checks that a piece of code doesn't die. This allows your test script to "
"continue, rather than aborting if you get an unexpected exception. For "
"example:\n"
"\n"
"    sub read_file {         my $file = shift;         local $/;         open "
"my $fh, '<', $file or die \"open failed ($!)\\n\";         $file = "

"\n"
"         lives_ok( sub { $file = read_file('test.txt') }, 'file read' );\n"

"\n"
"A true value is returned if the test succeeds, false otherwise. On exit $@ "
"is guaranteed to be the cause of death (if any).\n"
"\n"
"The test description is optional, but recommended. \n"

"  my $file;   lives_ok { $file = read_file('answer.txt') } 'read_file "

"a few dependencies, namely Devel::Declare and Scope::Upper which are "
"occasionally problematic, and the additional catch filtering uses Moose type "
"constraints which may not be desirable either.\n"
"\n"
"The main focus of this module is to provide simple and reliable error "
"handling for those having a hard time installing TryCatch, but who still "
"want to write correct 'eval' blocks without 5 lines of boilerplate each "
"time.\n"
"\n"
"It's designed to work as correctly as possible in light of the various "
"pathological edge cases (see BACKGROUND) and to be compatible with any style "
"of error values (simple strings, references, objects, overloaded objects, "
"etc).\n"
"\n"
"If the 'try' block dies, it returns the value of the last statement executed "
"in the 'catch' block, if there is one. Otherwise, it returns 'undef' in "
"scalar context or the empty list in list context. The following examples all "
"assign '\"bar\"' to '$x':\n"
"\n"
"  my $x = try { die \"foo\" } catch { \"bar\" };   my $x = try { die \"foo"
"\" } || \"bar\";   my $x = (try { die \"foo\" }) // \"bar\";\n"
"\n"
"  my $x = eval { die \"foo\" } || \"bar\";\n"
"\n"
"You can add 'finally' blocks, yielding the following:\n"
"\n"
"  my $x;   try { die 'foo' } finally { $x = 'bar' };   try { die 'foo' } "
"catch { warn \"Got a die: $_\" } finally { $x = 'bar' };\n"
"\n"
"'finally' blocks are always executed making them suitable for cleanup code "
"which cannot be handled using local. You can add as many 'finally' blocks to "
"a given 'try' block as you like.\n"
"\n"
"Note that adding a 'finally' block without a preceding 'catch' block "
"suppresses any errors. This behaviour is consistent with using a standalone "
"'eval', but it is not consistent with 'try'/'finally' patterns found in "
"other programming languages, such as Java, Python, Javascript or C#. If you "
"learnt the 'try'/'finally' pattern from one of these languages, watch out "

"This module implements the 'URI' class. Objects of this class represent "
"\"Uniform Resource Identifier references\" as specified in RFC 2396 (and "

"\n"
"A Uniform Resource Identifier is a compact string of characters that "
"identifies an abstract or physical resource. A Uniform Resource Identifier "
"can be further classified as either a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or a "
"Uniform Resource Name (URN). The distinction between URL and URN does not "
"matter to the 'URI' class interface. A \"URI-reference\" is a URI that may "
"have additional information attached in the form of a fragment identifier.\n"
"\n"
"An absolute URI reference consists of three parts: a _scheme_, a _scheme-"
"specific part_ and a _fragment_ identifier. A subset of URI references share "
"a common syntax for hierarchical namespaces. For these, the scheme-specific "
"part is further broken down into _authority_, _path_ and _query_ components. "
"These URIs can also take the form of relative URI references, where the "
"scheme (and usually also the authority) component is missing, but implied by "
"the context of the URI reference. The three forms of URI reference syntax "
"are summarized as follows:\n"
"\n"
"  <scheme>:<scheme-specific-part>#<fragment>   <scheme>://<authority><path>?"
"<query>#<fragment>   <path>?<query>#<fragment>\n"
"\n"
"The components into which a URI reference can be divided depend on the "
"_scheme_. The 'URI' class provides methods to get and set the individual "
"components. The methods available for a specific 'URI' object depend on the "
"scheme."

"One for each piece of data in your object. While some will be unique, doing "
"value checks and special storage tricks, most will simply be exercises in "
"repetition. Not only is it Bad Style to have a bunch of repetitious code, "
"but it's also simply not lazy, which is the real tragedy.\n"
"\n"
"If you make your module a subclass of Class::Accessor and declare your "

"    package Foo;     use base qw(Class::Accessor);     Foo-"

"This module provide a few functions that traverse their argument and "
"produces a string as its result. The string contains Perl code that, when "
"'eval'ed, produces a deep copy of the original arguments.\n"
"\n"
"The main feature of the module is that it strives to produce output that is "
"easy to read. Example:\n"
"\n"
"    @a = (1, [2, 3], {4 => 5});     dump(@a);\n"
"\n"
"Produces:\n"
"\n"
"    \"(1, [2, 3], { 4 => 5 })\"\n"
"\n"
"If you dump just a little data, it is output on a single line. If you dump "
"data that is more complex or there is a lot of it, line breaks are "
"automatically added to keep it easy to read.\n"
"\n"
"The following functions are provided (only the dd* functions are exported by "
"default): \n"
"* dump( ... ) \n"
"* pp( ... )\n"
"\n"
"  Returns a string containing a Perl expression. If you pass this string "
"to   Perl's built-in eval() function it should return a copy of the "
"arguments   you passed to dump().\n"
"\n"
"  If you call the function with multiple arguments then the output will be   "
"wrapped in parenthesis \"( ..., ... )\". If you call the function with a   "
"single argument the output will not have the wrapping. If you call the   "
"function with a single scalar (non-reference) argument it will just   return "
"the scalar quoted if needed, but never break it into multiple   lines. If "
"you pass multiple arguments or references to arrays of hashes   then the "
"return value might contain line breaks to format it for easier   reading. "
"The returned string will never be \"\\n\" terminated, even if   contains "
"multiple lines. This allows code like this to place the   semicolon in the "
"expected place:\n"
"\n"
"     print '$obj = ', dump($obj), \";\\n\";\n"
"\n"
"  If dump() is called in void context, then the dump is printed on STDERR   "
"and then \"\\n\" terminated. You might find this useful for quick debug   "
"printouts, but the dd*() functions might be better alternatives for this.\n"
"\n"
"  There is no difference between dump() and pp(), except that dump() "
"shares   its name with a not-so-useful perl builtin. Because of this some "
"might   want to avoid using that name. \n"
"* quote( $string )\n"
"\n"
"  Returns a quoted version of the provided string.\n"
"\n"
"  It differs from 'dump($string)' in that it will quote even numbers and   "
"not try to come up with clever expressions that might shorten the output.   "
"If a non-scalar argument is provided then it's just stringified instead   of "
"traversed. \n"
"* dd( ... ) \n"
"* ddx( ... )\n"
"\n"
"  These functions will call dump() on their argument and print the result   "
"to STDOUT (actually, it's the currently selected output handle, but   STDOUT "
"is the default for that).\n"
"\n"
"  The difference between them is only that ddx() will prefix the lines it   "
"prints with \"# \" and mark the first line with the file and line number   "
"where it was called. This is meant to be useful for debug printouts of   "
"state within programs. \n"
"* dumpf( ..., \\&filter )\n"
"\n"
"  Short hand for calling the dump_filtered() function of the   Data::Dump::"
"Filtered manpage. This works like dump(), but the last   argument should be "
"a filter callback function. As objects are visited the   filter callback is "
"invoked and it can modify how the objects are dumped."

"Log::Log4perl lets you remote-control and fine-tune the logging behaviour of "
"your system from the outside. It implements the widely popular (Java-based) "
"Log4j logging package in pure Perl. \n"
"*For a detailed tutorial on Log::Log4perl usage, please read*\n"
"\n"
"http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/09/11/log4perl.html\n"
"\n"
"Logging beats a debugger if you want to know what's going on in your code "
"during runtime. However, traditional logging packages are too static and "
"generate a flood of log messages in your log files that won't help you.\n"
"\n"
"'Log::Log4perl' is different. It allows you to control the number of logging "
"messages generated at three different levels:\n"
"\n"
"  * At a central location in your system (either in a configuration file or "
"in the startup code) you specify _which components_ (classes, functions) of "
"your system should generate logs.\n"
"\n"
"  * You specify how detailed the logging of these components should be by "
"specifying logging _levels_.\n"
"\n"
"  * You also specify which so-called _appenders_ you want to feed your log "
"messages to (\"Print it to the screen and also append it to /tmp/my.log\") "
"and which format (\"Write the date first, then the file name and line "
"number, and then the log message\") they should be in.\n"
"\n"
"This is a very powerful and flexible mechanism. You can turn on and off your "
"logs at any time, specify the level of detail and make that dependent on the "
"subsystem that's currently executed.\n"
"\n"
"Let me give you an example: You might find out that your system has a "
"problem in the 'MySystem::Helpers::ScanDir' component. Turning on detailed "
"debugging logs all over the system would generate a flood of useless log "
"messages and bog your system down beyond recognition. With 'Log::Log4perl', "
"however, you can tell the system: \"Continue to log only severe errors to "
"the log file. Open a second log file, turn on full debug logs in the "
"'MySystem::Helpers::ScanDir' component and dump all messages originating "
"from there into the new log file\". And all this is possible by just "
"changing the parameters in a configuration file, which your system can re-"
"read even while it's running!"

"This module tries to make install path resolution as easy as possible.\n"
"\n"
"When you want to install a module, it needs to figure out where to install "
"things. The nutshell version of how this works is that default installation "
"locations are determined from the ExtUtils::Config manpage, and they may be "
"individually overridden by using the 'install_path' attribute. An "
"'install_base' attribute lets you specify an alternative installation root "
"like _/home/foo_ and 'prefix' does something similar in a rather different "
"(and more complicated) way. 'destdir' lets you specify a temporary "
"installation directory like _/tmp/install_ in case you want to create "
"bundled-up installable packages.\n"
"\n"
"The following types are supported by default. \n"
"* * lib\n"

"* * arch\n"

"  \"Architecture-dependent\" module files, usually produced by compiling "
"XS,   the Inline manpage, or similar code. \n"
"* * script\n"

"  Programs written in pure Perl. In order to improve reuse, you may want "

"something. Pretty rare to see this in a perl distribution, but it   "
"happens. \n"
"* * bindoc\n"

"from   the POD in those files. Under Unix, these are manual pages belonging "
"to   the 'man1' category. Unless explicitly set, this is only available on   "

"Lingua::Translit can be used to convert text from one writing system to "

"\n"
"The term 'transliteration' describes the conversion of text from one writing "
"system or alphabet to another one. The conversion is ideally unique, mapping "
"one character to exactly one character, so the original spelling can be "
"reconstructed. Practically this is not always the case and one single letter "
"of the original alphabet can be transcribed as two, three or even more "
"letters.\n"
"\n"
"Furthermore there is more than one transliteration scheme for one writing "
"system. Therefore it is an important and necessary information, which scheme "
"will be or has been used to transliterate a text, to work integrative and be "
"able to reconstruct the original data.\n"
"\n"
"Reconstruction is a problem though for non-unique transliterations, if no "
"language specific knowledge is available as the resulting clusters of "
"letters may be ambiguous. For example, the Greek character \"PSI\" maps to "
"\"ps\", but \"ps\" could also result from the sequence \"PI\", \"SIGMA\" "
"since \"PI\" maps to \"p\" and \"SIGMA\" maps to s. If a transliteration "
"table leads to ambiguous conversions, the provided table cannot be used "
"reverse.\n"

"This module allows you to manage a set of deprecations for one or more "
"modules.\n"
"\n"
"When you import 'Package::DeprecationManager', you must provide a set of '-"
"deprecations' as a hash ref. The keys are \"feature\" names, and the values "
"are the version when that feature was deprecated.\n"
"\n"
"In many cases, you can simply use the fully qualified name of a subroutine "
"or method as the feature name. This works for cases where the whole "
"subroutine is deprecated. However, the feature names can be any string. This "
"is useful if you don't want to deprecate an entire subroutine, just a "
"certain usage.\n"
"\n"
"You can also provide an optional array reference in the '-ignore' "
"parameter.\n"
"\n"
"The values to be ignored can be package names or regular expressions (made "
"with 'qr//'). Use this to ignore packages in your distribution that can "
"appear on the call stack when a deprecated feature is used.\n"
"\n"
"As part of the import process, 'Package::DeprecationManager' will export two "
"subroutines into its caller. It provides an 'import()' sub for the caller "
"and a 'deprecated()' sub.\n"
"\n"
"The 'import()' sub allows callers of _your_ class to specify an '-"
"api_version' parameter. If this is supplied, then deprecation warnings are "
"only issued for deprecations with API versions earlier than the one "
"specified.\n"
"\n"
"You must call the 'deprecated()' sub in each deprecated subroutine. When "
"called, it will issue a warning using 'Carp::cluck()'.\n"
"\n"
"The 'deprecated()' sub can be called in several ways. If you do not pass any "
"arguments, it will generate an appropriate warning message. If you pass a "
"single argument, this is used as the warning message.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, you can call it with named arguments. Currently, the only allowed "
"names are 'message' and 'feature'. The 'feature' argument should correspond "
"to the feature name passed in the '-deprecations' hash.\n"
"\n"
"If you don't explicitly specify a feature, the 'deprecated()' sub uses "
"'caller()' to identify its caller, using its fully qualified subroutine "
"name.\n"
"\n"
"A given deprecation warning is only issued once for a given package. This "
"module tracks this based on both the feature name _and_ the error message "
"itself. This means that if you provide several different error messages for "
"the same feature, all of those errors will appear."

"'Path::Class' is a module for manipulation of file and directory "
"specifications (strings describing their locations, like ''/home/ken/foo."

"pretty much every platform Perl runs on, including Unix, Windows, Mac, VMS, "
"Epoc, Cygwin, OS/2, and NetWare.\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"In fact, 'Path::Class' uses 'File::Spec' internally, wrapping all the "
"unsightly details so you can concentrate on your application code. Whereas "
"'File::Spec' provides functions for some common path manipulations, 'Path::"
"Class' provides an object-oriented model of the world of path specifications "
"and their underlying semantics. 'File::Spec' doesn't create any objects, and "
"its classes represent the different ways in which paths must be manipulated "
"on various platforms (not a very intuitive concept). 'Path::Class' creates "
"objects representing files and directories, and provides methods that relate "
"them to each other. For instance, the following 'File::Spec' code:\n"
"\n"
" my $absolute = File::Spec->file_name_is_absolute(                   File::"
"Spec->catfile( @dirs, $file )                 );\n"

" my $absolute = Path::Class::File->new( @dirs, $file )->is_absolute;\n"
"\n"
"or even as\n"
"\n"
" my $absolute = file( @dirs, $file )->is_absolute;\n"
"\n"
"Similar readability improvements should happen all over the place when using "
"'Path::Class'.\n"
"\n"
"Using 'Path::Class' can help solve real problems in your code too - for "
"instance, how many people actually take the \"volume\" (like 'C:' on "
"Windows) into account when writing 'File::Spec'-using code? I thought not. "
"But if you use 'Path::Class', your file and directory objects will know what "
"volumes they refer to and do the right thing.\n"

#. Module-Development-Tools/perl-Spiffy/description
msgid ""
"\"Spiffy\" is a framework and methodology for doing object oriented (OO) "
"programming in Perl. Spiffy combines the best parts of Exporter.pm, base.pm, "
"mixin.pm and SUPER.pm into one magic foundation class. It attempts to fix "
"all the nits and warts of traditional Perl OO, in a clean, straightforward "
"and (perhaps someday) standard way.\n"
"\n"
"Spiffy borrows ideas from other OO languages like Python, Ruby, Java and "
"Perl 6. It also adds a few tricks of its own.\n"
"\n"
"If you take a look on CPAN, there are a ton of OO related modules. When "
"starting a new project, you need to pick the set of modules that makes most "
"sense, and then you need to use those modules in each of your classes. "
"Spiffy, on the other hand, has everything you'll probably need in one "
"module, and you only need to use it once in one of your classes. If you make "
"Spiffy.pm the base class of the basest class in your project, Spiffy will "
"automatically pass all of its magic to all of your subclasses. You may "
"eventually forget that you're even using it!\n"
"\n"
"The most striking difference between Spiffy and other Perl object oriented "
"base classes, is that it has the ability to export things. If you create a "
"subclass of Spiffy, all the things that Spiffy exports will automatically be "
"exported by your subclass, in addition to any more things that you want to "
"export. And if someone creates a subclass of your subclass, all of those "
"things will be exported automatically, and so on. Think of it as \"Inherited "
"Exportation\", and it uses the familiar Exporter.pm specification syntax.\n"
"\n"
"To use Spiffy or any subclass of Spiffy as a base class of your class, you "
"specify the '-base' argument to the 'use' command.\n"
"\n"
"    use MySpiffyBaseModule -base;\n"
"\n"
"You can also use the traditional 'use base 'MySpiffyBaseModule';' syntax and "
"everything will work exactly the same. The only caveat is that Spiffy.pm "
"must already be loaded. That's because Spiffy rewires base.pm on the fly to "
"do all the Spiffy magics.\n"
"\n"
"Spiffy has support for Ruby-like mixins with Perl6-like roles. Just like "
"'base' you can use either of the following invocations:\n"
"\n"
"    use mixin 'MySpiffyBaseModule';     use MySpiffyBaseModule -mixin;\n"
"\n"
"The second version will only work if the class being mixed in is a subclass "
"of Spiffy. The first version will work in all cases, as long as Spiffy has "
"already been loaded.\n"
"\n"
"To limit the methods that get mixed in, use roles. (Hint: they work just "
"like an Exporter list):\n"
"\n"
"    use MySpiffyBaseModule -mixin => qw(:basics x y !foo);\n"
"\n"
"In object oriented Perl almost every subroutine is a method. Each method "
"gets the object passed to it as its first argument. That means practically "
"every subroutine starts with the line:\n"
"\n"
"    my $self = shift;\n"
"\n"
"Spiffy provides a simple, optional filter mechanism to insert that line for "
"you, resulting in cleaner code. If you figure an average method has 10 lines "
"of code, that's 10% of your code! To turn this option on, you just use the "
"'- Base' option instead of the '-base' option, or add the '-selfless' "
"option. If source filtering makes you queazy, don't use the feature. I "
"personally find it addictive in my quest for writing squeaky clean, "
"maintainable code.\n"
"\n"
"A useful feature of Spiffy is that it exports two functions: 'field' and "
"'const' that can be used to declare the attributes of your class, and "
"automatically generate accessor methods for them. The only difference "
"between the two functions is that 'const' attributes can not be modified; "
"thus the accessor is much faster.\n"
"\n"
"One interesting aspect of OO programming is when a method calls the same "
"method from a parent class. This is generally known as calling a super "
"method. Perl's facility for doing this is butt ugly:\n"
"\n"
"    sub cleanup {         my $self = shift;         $self->scrub;         "
"$self->SUPER::cleanup(@_);     }\n"
"\n"
"Spiffy makes it, er, super easy to call super methods. You just use the "
"'super' function. You don't need to pass it any arguments because it "
"automatically passes them on for you. Here's the same function with Spiffy:\n"
"\n"
"    sub cleanup {         $self->scrub;         super;     }\n"
"\n"
"Spiffy has a special method for parsing arguments called 'parse_arguments', "
"that it also uses for parsing its own arguments. You declare which arguments "
"are boolean (singletons) and which ones are paired, with two special methods "
"called 'boolean_arguments' and 'paired_arguments'. Parse arguments pulls out "
"the booleans and pairs and returns them in an anonymous hash, followed by a "
"list of the unmatched arguments.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, Spiffy can export a few debugging functions 'WWW', 'XXX', 'YYY' and "
"'ZZZ'. Each of them produces a YAML dump of its arguments. WWW warns the "
"output, XXX dies with the output, YYY prints the output, and ZZZ confesses "
"the output. If YAML doesn't suit your needs, you can switch all the dumps to "
"Data::Dumper format with the '-dumper' option.\n"
"\n"
"That's Spiffy!"

"The Switch.pm module implements a generalized case mechanism that covers "
"most (but not all) of the numerous possible combinations of switch and case "
"values described above.\n"
"\n"
"The module augments the standard Perl syntax with two new control "
"statements: 'switch' and 'case'. The 'switch' statement takes a single "
"scalar argument of any type, specified in parentheses. 'switch' stores this "
"value as the current switch value in a (localized) control variable. The "
"value is followed by a block which may contain one or more Perl statements "
"(including the 'case' statement described below). The block is "
"unconditionally executed once the switch value has been cached.\n"
"\n"
"A 'case' statement takes a single scalar argument (in mandatory parentheses "
"if it's a variable; otherwise the parens are optional) and selects the "
"appropriate type of matching between that argument and the current switch "
"value. The type of matching used is determined by the respective types of "
"the switch value and the 'case' argument, as specified in Table 1. If the "
"match is successful, the mandatory block associated with the 'case' "
"statement is executed.\n"
"\n"
"In most other respects, the 'case' statement is semantically identical to an "
"'if' statement. For example, it can be followed by an 'else' clause, and can "
"be used as a postfix statement qualifier.\n"
"\n"
"However, when a 'case' block has been executed control is automatically "
"transferred to the statement after the immediately enclosing 'switch' block, "
"rather than to the next statement within the block. In other words, the "
"success of any 'case' statement prevents other cases in the same scope from "
"executing. But see the \"Allowing fall-through\" manpage below.\n"
"\n"
"Together these two new statements provide a fully generalized case "
"mechanism:\n"
"\n"
"        use Switch;\n"
"\n"
"        \n"
"\n"
"        %special = ( woohoo => 1,  d'oh => 1 );\n"

"$special{$_}                 case /[a-z]/i   { print \"alpha\\n\"; }      # "
"if $_ =~ /a-z/i                 case [1..9]     { print \"small num\\n\"; }  "

"\\W/;  # if $_ ~= /\\W/ \t    }         }\n"
"\n"
"Note that 'switch'es can be nested within 'case' (or any other) blocks, and "
"a series of 'case' statements can try different types of matches -- hash "
"membership, pattern match, array intersection, simple equality, etc. -- "
"against the same switch value.\n"
"\n"
"The use of intersection tests against an array reference is particularly "

msgid ""
"Testing is usually the ugly part of Perl module authoring. Perl gives you a "
"standard way to run tests with Test::Harness, and basic testing primitives "
"with Test::More. After that you are pretty much on your own to develop a "
"testing framework and philosophy. Test::More encourages you to make your own "
"framework by subclassing Test::Builder, but that is not trivial.\n"
"\n"
"Test::Base gives you a way to write your own test framework base class that "
"_is_ trivial. In fact it is as simple as two lines:\n"
"\n"
"    package MyTestFramework;     use Test::Base -Base;\n"
"\n"
"A module called 'MyTestFramework.pm' containing those two lines, will give "
"all the power of Test::More and all the power of Test::Base to every test "
"file that uses it. As you build up the capabilities of 'MyTestFramework', "
"your tests will have all of that power as well.\n"
"\n"
"'MyTestFramework' becomes a place for you to put all of your reusable "
"testing bits. As you write tests, you will see patterns and duplication, and "
"you can \"upstream\" them into 'MyTestFramework'. Of course, you don't have "
"to subclass Test::Base at all. You can use it directly in many applications, "
"including everywhere you would use Test::More.\n"
"\n"
"Test::Base concentrates on offering reusable data driven patterns, so that "
"you can write tests with a minimum of code. At the heart of all testing you "
"have inputs, processes and expected outputs. Test::Base provides some clean "
"ways for you to express your input and expected output data, so you can "
"spend your\n"
"\n"
"      time focusing on that rather than your code scaffolding."

msgid ""
"If you don't know anything about automated testing in Perl then you should "
"probably read about Test::Simple and Test::More before preceding. Test::Deep "
"uses the Test::Builder framework.\n"
"\n"
"Test::Deep gives you very flexible ways to check that the result you got is "
"the result you were expecting. At it's simplest it compares two structures "
"by going through each level, ensuring that the values match, that arrays and "
"hashes have the same elements and that references are blessed into the "
"correct class. It also handles circular data structures without getting "
"caught in an infinite loop.\n"
"\n"
"Where it becomes more interesting is in allowing you to do something besides "
"simple exact comparisons. With strings, the 'eq' operator checks that 2 "
"strings are exactly equal but sometimes that's not what you want. When you "
"don't know exactly what the string should be but you do know some things "
"about how it should look, 'eq' is no good and you must use pattern matching "
"instead. Test::Deep provides pattern matching for complex data structures\n"

"Net::Telnet allows you to make client connections to a TCP port and do "
"network I/O, especially to a port using the TELNET protocol. Simple I/O "
"methods such as print, get, and getline are provided. More sophisticated "
"interactive features are provided because connecting to a TELNET port "
"ultimately means communicating with a program designed for human "
"interaction. These interactive features include the ability to specify a "
"time-out and to wait for patterns to appear in the input stream, such as the "
"prompt from a shell. IPv6 support is available when using perl 5.14 or later "
"(see 'family()'.\n"
"\n"
"Other reasons to use this module than strictly with a TELNET port are: \n"
"* *\n"
"\n"
"  You're not familiar with sockets and you want a simple way to make "
"client   connections to TCP services. \n"
"* *\n"
"\n"
"  You want to be able to specify your own time-out while connecting,   "
"reading, or writing. \n"
"* *\n"
"\n"
"  You're communicating with an interactive program at the other end of "
"some   socket or pipe and you want to wait for certain patterns to appear.\n"
"\n"
"Here's an example that prints who's logged-on to a remote host. In addition "
"to a username and password, you must also know the user's shell prompt, "
