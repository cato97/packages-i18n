"Kyoto Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a database. The database "
"is a simple data file containing records, each is a pair of a key and a "
"value. Every key and value is serial bytes with variable length. Both binary "
"data and character string can be used as a key and a value. Each key must be "
"unique within a database. There is neither concept of data tables nor data "
"types. Records are organized in hash table or B+ tree.\n"
"\n"
"Kyoto Cabinet runs very fast. For example, elapsed time to store one million "
"records is 0.9 seconds for hash database, and 1.1 seconds for B+ tree "
"database. Moreover, the size of database is very small. For example, "
"overhead for a record is 16 bytes for hash database, and 4 bytes for B+ tree "
"database. Furthermore, scalability of Kyoto Cabinet is great. The database "
"size can be up to 8EB (9.22e18 bytes).\n"
"\n"
"Kyoto Cabinet is written in the C++ language, and provided as API of C++, C, "
"Java, Python, Ruby, Perl, and Lua. Kyoto Cabinet is available on platforms "
"which have API conforming to C++03 with the TR1 library extensions. Kyoto "
"Cabinet is a free software licensed under the GNU General Public License. On "
"the other hand, a commercial license is also provided. If you use Kyoto "
