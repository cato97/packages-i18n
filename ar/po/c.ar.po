"Chrony is an implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP). It can "
"synchronize the system clock with NTP servers, reference clocks (e.g. a GPS "
"receiver), and manual input using wristwatch and keyboard. It can also "
"operate as an NTPv4 (RFC 5905) server and peer to provide a time service to "
"other computers in the network.\n"
"\n"
"Chrony consists of two programs: chronyd and chronyc.\n"
"\n"
"Chronyd is a daemon which runs in the background on the system. It obtains "
"measurements of the system clockâ€™s offset relative to time servers on other "
"systems via the network and adjusts the system time accordingly. For "
"isolated systems, the user can periodically enter the correct time by hand "
"(using chronyc). In either case, chronyd determines the rate at which the "
"computer gains or loses time, and compensates for this. Chronyd can act as "
"either a client or a server.\n"
"\n"
"Chronyc provides a user interface to chronyd for monitoring its performance "
"and configuring various settings. It can do so while running on the same "
"computer as the chronyd instance it is controlling or a different computer."
