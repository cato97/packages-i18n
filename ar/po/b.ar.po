"Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) is a set of Java classes that provides "
"scripting language support within Java applications and access to Java "
"objects and methods from scripting languages. BSF allows writing JSPs in "
"languages other than Java while providing access to the Java class library. "
"In addition, BSF permits any Java application to be implemented in part (or "
"dynamically extended) by a language that is embedded within it. This is "
"achieved by providing an API that permits calling scripting language engines "
"from within Java as well as an object registry that exposes Java objects to "
"these scripting language engines.\n"
"\n"
"This BSF package currently supports several scripting languages: *    "
"Javascript (using Rhino ECMAScript, from the Mozilla project)\n"
"* XSLT Stylesheets (as a component of Apache XML project's Xalan and    "
"Xerces)\n"
"\n"
"In addition, the following languages are supported with their own    BSF "
"engines: * Java (using BeanShell, from the BeanShell project)\n"
"* JRuby\n"
"* JudoScript"

#. Module-Development-Tools/bsh2/description
msgid ""
"BeanShell is a small, free, embeddable, Java source interpreter with object "
"scripting language features, written in Java. BeanShell executes standard "
"Java statements and expressions, in addition to obvious scripting commands "
"and syntax. BeanShell supports scripted objects as simple method closures "
"like those in Perl and JavaScript(tm). You can use BeanShell interactively "
"for Java experimentation and debugging or as a simple scripting engine for "
"your applications. In short: BeanShell is a dynamically interpreted Java, "
"plus some useful stuff. Another way to describe it is to say that in many "
"ways BeanShell is to Java as Tcl/Tk is to C: BeanShell is embeddable - You "
"can call BeanShell from your Java applications to execute Java code "
"dynamically at run-time or to provide scripting extensibility for your "
"applications. Alternatively, you can call your Java applications and objects "
"from BeanShell; working with Java objects and APIs dynamically. Since "
"BeanShell is written in Java and runs in the same space as your application, "
"you can freely pass references to \"real live\" objects into scripts and "
"return them as results.\n"
"\n"
"With version 2.0 BeanShell becomes a fully Java compatible scripting "
"language. BeanShell is now capable of interpreting ordinary Java source and "
"loading .java source files from the class path. BeanShell scripted classes "
"are fully typed and appear to outside Java code and via reflective "
"inspection as ordinary classes. However their implementation is fully "
"dynamic and they may include arbitrary BeanShell scripts in their bodies, "
"methods, and constructors. Users may now freely mix loose, unstructured "
"BeanShell scripts, method closures, and full scripted classes."
