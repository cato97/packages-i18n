"images. The bsdtar program is an implementation of tar(1) that is built on "
"top of libarchive. It started as a test harness, but has grown and is now "
"the standard system tar for FreeBSD 5 and 6.\n"
"\n"
"The libarchive library offers a number of features that make it both very "
"flexible and very powerful. \n"
"- Automatic format detection: libarchive can automatically determine    both "
"the compression and the archive format, regardless of the    data source. "
"Most tar implementations do not automatically detect    the compression "
"format, few implementation that can correctly do    this when reading from "
"stdin or a socket. (The tar program    included with Gunnar Ritter's "
"heirloom collection also does full    automatic format detection.) \n"
"- Writes POSIX formats: libarchive writes POSIX-standard formats,    "
"including \"ustar,\" \"pax interchange format,\" and the POSIX \"cpio\"    "
"format. \n"
"- Supports pax interchange format: Pax interchange format (which,    despite "
"the name, is really an extended tar format) eliminates    almost all "
"limitations of historic tar formats and provides a    standard method for "
"incorporating vendor-specific extensions.    libarchive exploits this "
"extension mechanism to support ACLs and    file flags, for example. (Joerg "
"Schilling's star archiver is    another open-source tar program that "
"supports pax interchange    format.) \n"
"- Reads popular formats: libarchive can read GNU tar, ustar, pax    "
"interchange format, cpio, and older tar variants. The internal    "
"architecture is easily extensible. The only requirement for    support is "
"that it be possible to read the format without seeking    in the file. (For "
"example, a format that includes a compressed    size field before the data "
"cannot be correctly written without    seeking.) \n"
"- High-Level API: the libarchive API makes it fairly simple to build    an "
"archive from a list of filenames or to extract the entries    from an "
"archive. However, the API also provides extreme    flexibility with regards "
"to data sources. For example, there are    generic hooks that allow you to "
"write an archive to a socket or    read data from an archive entry into a "
"memory buffer. \n"
"- Extensible. The internal design uses generic interfaces for compression, "
"archive format detection and decoding, and archive data I/O. It should be "
"very easy to add new formats, new compression methods, or new ways of "
"reading/writing archives."

"LV2 is a portable plugin standard for audio systems, similar in scope to "
"LADSPA, VST, AU, and others. It defines a C API for code and a format for "
"data files which collectively describe a plugin. LV2 consists of a simple "
"core (roughly equivalent in power to LADSPA) which can be extended to "
"support more advanced functionality. This allows the interface to be \"grown"
"\" to accommodate the needs of real software as they arise.\n"
"\n"
"LV2 is both a stable interface and a forward-moving project: there is a "
"stable set of \"official\" extensions in use while new functionality is "
"actively developed. Anyone can extend LV2, which allows developers to try "
"out new ideas and ensure they work in practice. Good extensions are vetted "
"by the community and included in the official distribution so they can be "
"relied on to be widely supported. This open development model means "
"developers can always scratch their itch without a central authority getting "
"in the way. The current stable release includes most functionality required "
"by modern plugins, including:\n"
"\n"
"  * Audio, control, \"control voltage\" (audio-rate control), and event     "
"(e.g. MIDI) input and output   * Expressive open-ended port metadata, "
"including:     - \"Meaningful\" controls (e.g. gain or envelope attack) "
"allowing intelligent       host control or UI generation     - Control units "
"(e.g. Hz, octaves, dB)     - Multi-channel port groups (e.g. stereo, 5.1 "
"surround, ambisonics   * Embeddable GUIs in any toolkit, with support for a "
"full plugin/UI split     (including network transparency in capable hosts)   "
"* Ability to bundle any files (e.g. samples or impulses) with plugins   * "
"Presets (bundled and/or user saved)   * Plugin state saving and restoring   "
"* Host-managed logging   * Non-realtime plugin worker methods (simple and "
"portable host-managed     threading)   * Message-based plugin communication, "
"allowing plugins/UIs to have advanced     interfaces without host support or "
"specifications getting in the way   * Transport awareness, both real time "
"and tempo time (bars, beats, etc-.)\n"
"\n"
"LV2 has graceful compatibility \"baked in\": for example, a simple amplifier "
"plugin might have audio in/out with a gain control, and function in any "
"host. The same plugin could have a fancy GUI and transport awareness which "
"optionally work in hosts that support these features. Conversely, hosts know "
"not to load plugins that require features it does not support.\n"
"\n"
"See the specification index for complete documentation. If you are a host or "
"plugin author and need missing functionality, please file a ticket or let us "
"know your requirements on  the mailing list. LV2 is a community project that "
"depends on your feedback to improve - unknown requirements are unmet "
"requirements!"
